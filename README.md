## Technologies Uses:

React, MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, Javascript

## How it works:

>>  **Users** upon signing up will have access to a sixteen pad electronic drum kit
    with recording capabilities. After recording they may add their track to their personal
    profile page, add, delete and edit commentaries regarding the tune. Users may also
    check out other musicians' profiles and tracks via our community page.


## Moving Forward:

1. Improving functionality of Beat Pad, expanding the recording capabilities
    to incorporate tempo changes, use of samples, and the ability to cut up tracks.

2. Expand the platform to incorporate other music-oriented applications, such as 
    ableton, spotify, and bandTogether

3. Create interfaces for other musical instruments, such as keyboard and stringed 
    instruments
